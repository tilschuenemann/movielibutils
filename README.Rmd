## Similar packages and differences

[TMDb by AndreaCapozio](https://github.com/AndreaCapozio/TMDb)

The TMDb package has a much broader functionality than movielibutils - tv shows, movies, people, collections, while movielibutils only looks up a movies id, its details, cast and crew.

While TMDb returns lists, movielibutils delivers data.tables, thus resulting in a format that is ready to analyze. movielibutils also works in batches, whereas TMDb only supplies single-call functions.
